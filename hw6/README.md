To compile and run my program:
1. Put all of Makefile counting.cpp Hashtable.cpp Hashtable.h avlbst.h bst.h under the same directory. 
2. Run `make` or `make counting` to compile
3. Use `./counting <input file> <output file> x d r` to run my program

My program will both print the run time to console and write it to the output file.
